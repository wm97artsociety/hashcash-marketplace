# hashcash-marketplace

Hash Cash (HC) is a custom-built, penny-pegged crypto token ecosystem designed as a decentralized free-market marketplace powered by its own blockchain â€” Manierism â€” using a Hashcash proof-of-work algorithm. The system includes a native mobile app (Android APK), web marketplace (Firebase), smart tax routing, and dynamic tiered tokenomics to promote fairness, security, and upward-only price growth.
